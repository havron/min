Sam Havron is a PhD student in computer science at Cornell University; he is in
residence at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in New York City. He currently
works on computer security and privacy issues in the context of intimate
partner violence (IPV). His research has been published at top security
conferences such as IEEE S&P, and featured by media outlets including the New

full of little lights, Sam can often be spotted reading books or exploring new
places.
