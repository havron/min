I'm a Security Engineer at [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com) in
[New York](/environs), working on interdisciplinary challenges in [product and infrastructure security](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2018/02/getting-product-security-engineering.html), as well as [privacy engineering](https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-engineer.html). Previously, I was a graduate research assistant at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu), where I
helped [establish](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-havron.pdf) the [first computer security and privacy clinic](https://www.ceta.tech.cornell.edu/) for survivors of intimate partner violence who are facing ongoing technology abuse. Here's a [bio for talks+press](/bio). 

(Yes, ironically this site is built with Hugo. A Squarespace version is
in the works!)
