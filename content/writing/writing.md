Here are some sample posts in place until I decide what I want to write
about.  I have been considering [different
ways](https://darekkay.com/blog/static-site-comments/) to include a comments
section for each post, but for now, please email me at `havron@cs.cornell.edu`
with your comment and I will post it along with a response if I have one to
add.
