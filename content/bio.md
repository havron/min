Here is a brief biography suitable for use in talk announcements,
press, etc; [this high-resolution image of me](/img/havron_sam.jpg) should be sufficient for small
printing. 

Sam Havron (he/him) is a Product Security Engineer at [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com) in New York, where he analyzes, designs, and builds large-scale systems to improve product security and privacy for millions of diverse creative professionals, photographers, artists, restaurants, and small businesses. Previously, he was a graduate researcher in security at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu), where he helped [establish](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-havron.pdf) the first [computer security and privacy clinic](https://ceta.tech.cornell.edu) for survivors of intimate partner violence who are facing ongoing technology abuse. His research has been published at top security
conferences such as IEEE S&P and USENIX Security, featured by media outlets including the [New
York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/phone-apps-stalking.html), [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614168/nyc-hires-hackers-to-hit-back-at-stalkerware/), and [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/eva-galperin-stalkerware-kaspersky-antivirus/), and received attention from a [U.S. Senator](https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1201897394939596807). Sam received an M.S. in Computer Science from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and a B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). When not staring at metal rectangles
full of little lights, Sam can often be spotted reading books or exploring new places.
