I'm a PhD candidate at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu). I'm part of a [research team](https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/) studying computer security and privacy issues in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), and I help lead a [computer security clinic](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/cornell-tech-opens-computer-security-clinic-for-victims-of-tech-enabled-intimate-partner-violence/) for IPV survivors in New York City.
My CV is available [here](/havron-cv.pdf).
