The source code is compiled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the theme is
based on [Cocoa Enhanced](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme), with
some modifications.

When there is a new commit to the source code, [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org) spins up a server to run [this
script](/.travis.yml), which compiles the source code and pushes the results to
the [havron.github.io](https://github.com/havron/havron.github.io). [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) then hosts the contents of that repo at
[https://havron.dev](https://havron.dev).
