I'm a PhD candidate at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu). I'm part of a [research team](https://www.ipvtechresearch.org/) studying computer security and privacy issues in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), and I help lead the first [computer security clinic](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/cornell-tech-opens-computer-security-clinic-for-victims-of-tech-enabled-intimate-partner-violence/) for IPV survivors, in New York City.
Here's a bio for [talks+press](/about), and [CV](/havron-cv.pdf).
